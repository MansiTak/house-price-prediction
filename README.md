# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features like location, area, condition, and more. It is built using Python and popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and xgboost.

##📁 Project Structure

house-price-prediction/
- data/                      (Contains the CSV dataset files)
- house_price_prediction.py  (Main script for training and evaluation)
- requirements.txt           (Project dependencies)
- .gitignore                 (Files ignored by Git)
- README.md                  (Project documentation)


🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
- cd house-price-prediction

2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
- python -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Required Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add Your Dataset
Place your train.csv and test.csv (or similar data files) inside the data/ folder.

5. Run the Script
python house_price_prediction.py


📊 Model Metrics Output
1. After training, the model will output:
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
3. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
4. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These help you assess how well your model is performing.
