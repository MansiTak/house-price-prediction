# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features like location, area, condition, and more. It is built using Python and popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, etc.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
house-price-prediction/
- data/train.csv             (Contains the CSV dataset files)
- house_price_prediction.py  (Main script for training and evaluation)
- requirements.txt           (Project dependencies)
- .gitignore                 (Files ignored by Git)
- README.md                  (Project documentation)
- app.py                     (Streamlit app script)
```

🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```
2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows use:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. Install Required Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Add Your Dataset
Place your train.csv and test.csv (or similar data files) inside the data/ folder.

6. Run the Script
```
python house_price_prediction.py
```
